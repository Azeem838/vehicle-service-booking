<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project follows the business requirements layout on [here](https://www.notion.so/Final-Capstone-Project-Book-an-Appointment-41ded2ee99ff4fe4becf91acb332ca26).
From these requirements, this app adapts the following workflow:

1. The user logs into the app by registering with their username, email and password
2. The user is presented with a list of services where more information can be viewed for each service
3. The user selects a service and access to the service details page
4. On the service detail page, the user can decide to reserve an appointment to service their car: the user has to select a date, time and add a description if necessary
5. There is a page to check the list of appointments of the user
6. You may toggle dark mode if you wish :smiley:

This app was built using the Ionic React framework therefore the app is fully respoinsive but works best on mobile.

The [Ruby on Rails back-end]() was built using Rails with 3 models:

1. Users Model
2. Appointments Model
3. Services Model

The app makes API requests while the user interacts with the app in order to retrieve the relevant information. The services database has been seeded with the various services since these services are assumed to be a finite number.
